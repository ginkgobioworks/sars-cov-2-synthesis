The nsp1-40S ribosome complex further induces an endonucleolytic cleavage near the 5'UTR of host mRNAs, targeting them for degradation. Viral mRNAs are not susceptible to nsp1-mediated endonucleolytic RNA cleavage thanks to the presence of a 5'-end leader sequence and are therefore protected from degradation. By suppressing host gene expression, nsp1 facilitates efficient viral gene expression in infected cells and evasion from host immune response.                                                                           |

Indeed, these two proteins play a role in maintaining the functional integrity of the mitochondria and protecting cells from various stresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

In addition, PL-PRO possesses a deubiquitinating/deISGylating activity and processes both 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains from cellular substrates. Participates together with nsp4 in the assembly of virally-induced cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles necessary for viral replication. Antagonizes innate immune induction of type I interferon by blocking the phosphorylation, dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation of host IRF3. Prevents also host NF-kappa-B signaling.                 |
