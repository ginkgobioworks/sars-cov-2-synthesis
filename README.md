# Ginkgo SARS-CoV-2 synthesis efforts

This repository makes available detailed information for freely available
synthesis efforts related to SARS-CoV-2 at [Ginkgo Bioworks](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/).

## Overview

Ginkgo is synthesizing SARS-CoV-2 constructs to help the scientific community
develop tests and vaccines to ameliorate the Covid-19 pandemic. We have tried to
widely understand community needs and provide a large collection of resources.

As constructs are synthesized and validated they'll be made available
without restrictions at:

- [Addgene](https://www.addgene.org/Ginkgo_Bioworks/)
- [The BioBricks Free Genes Project](https://biobricks.org/freegenes/)

We'll be sending weekly rounds of constructs to both locations, and this
repository provides detailed summaries, sequences and annotations to help make
them directly useful. We've provided information on constructs in progress or
planned to give direct insight into what is upcoming.

## Data

- [Top level summary of ongoing and planned projects](./summary/ginkgo-covid-summary.csv),
  grouped to provide context and details

- CSV level summary of constructs:
  - [E coli expression](./summary/ginkgo-covid-e-coli-expression.csv) --
    SARS-CoV-2 proteins in E coli vectors with various C-terminal tags for
    protein expression and purification.
  - [Yeast expression](./summary/ginkgo-covid-yeast-expression.csv) --
    SARS-CoV-2 proteins in Yeast expression vectors with various C-terminal
    tags.
  - [Mammalian expression](./summary/ginkgo-covid-mammalian-expression.csv) --
    Mammalian expression constructs with tags along with Spike protein
    constructs for expression and VSV pseudotyping.
  - [Viral parts](./summary/ginkgo-covid-viral-parts.csv) -- Plasmids containing
    viral DNA.
  - [Yeast plasmid backbone](./summary/ginkgo-covid-yeast-backbone.csv) -- 

- [Sequences and GFF annotation files for constructs](./sequences), with full
  annotations of features in each plasmid
